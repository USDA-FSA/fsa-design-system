**Abbreviations** are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. For example, writing "St." instead of "Street", or "Rx" for "prescription", or "D.C." for "District of Columbia."

**Acronyms** are a *type* of abbreviation. They shorten phrases in a specific way — using parts of the initial word or phrase (usually letters) to form an abbreviation. For example, <abbr title="Do it yourself">DIY</abbr> or <abbr title="As soon as possible">ASAP</abbr>.

In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms (abbreviations pronounced as words, like <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>) and initialisms (abbreviations pronounced as letters, like <abbr title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</abbr>). For simplicity, our content guide refers to both as acronyms. The readability issues that acronyms and initialisms create tend to be similar, and “acronym” is the more common term.

**Acronyms often confuse readers so avoid them whenever possible.**

If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For example, "General Services Administration (GSA)".

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example, <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</abbr>, and <abbr title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</abbr>. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s discretion.

At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference with a shortened name instead of an acronym. For example, use "Labor" in place of "Department of Labor," rather than "DOL."
